### Question 1:

Your serverless architecture using AWS API Gateway, AWS Lambda, and AWS DynamoDB experienced a large increase in traffic to a sustained 400 requests per second, and dramatically increased in failure rates. Your requests, during normal operation, last 500 milliseconds on average. Your DynamoDB table did not exceed 50% of provisioned throughput, and Table primary keys are designed correctly. What is the most likely issue?

- A. Your API Gateway deployment is throttling your requests.
- B. Your AWS API Gateway Deployment is bottlenecking on request (de)serialization.
- C. You did not request a limit increase on concurrent Lambda function executions.
- D. You used Consistent Read requests on DynamoDB and are experiencing semaphore lock.

Explanation:

Question 1@http://jayendrapatil.com/aws-lambda/

C: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html#limits_lambda

C: Refer â€“ AWS API Gateway by default throttles at 500 requests per second steady-state, and 1000 requests per second at spike. Lambda, by default, throttles at 100 concurrent requests for safety. At 500 milliseconds (half of a second) per request, you can expect to support 200 requests per second at 100 concurrency. This is less than the 400 requests per second your system now requires. Make a limit increase request via the AWS Support Console.
