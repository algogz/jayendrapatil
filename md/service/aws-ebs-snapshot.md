### Question 19:

Why are more frequent snapshots of EBS Volumes faster?

- A. Blocks in EBS Volumes are allocated lazily, since while logically separated from other EBS Volumes, Volumes often share the same physical hardware. Snapshotting the first time forces full block range allocation, so the second snapshot doesnâ€™t need to perform the allocation phase and is faster.
- B. The snapshots are incremental so that only the blocks on the device that have changed after your last snapshot are saved in the new snapshot.
- C. AWS provisions more disk throughput for burst capacity during snapshots if the drive has been pre-warmed by snapshotting and reading all blocks.
- D. The drive is pre-warmed, so block access is more rapid for volumes when every block on the device has already been read at least one time.

### Question 21:

There is a very serious outage at AWS. EC2 is not affected, but your EC2 instance deployment scripts stopped working in the region with the outage. What might be the issue?

- A. The AWS Console is down, so your CLI commands do not work.
- B. S3 is unavailable, so you canâ€™t create EBS volumes from a snapshot you use to deploy new volumes.
- C. AWS turns off the <code>DeployCode</code> API call when there are major outages, to protect from system floods.
- D. None of the other answers make sense. If EC2 is not affected, it must be some other issue.
